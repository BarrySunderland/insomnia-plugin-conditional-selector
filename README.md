# insomnia-plugin-conditional-selector
simple plugin for insomnia to allow setting environmental variables conditionally.
Can be combined with other environmental variables for added flexibility.

As a simple example with static variables:

if the condition is met:  
<img src="./assets/example_true.png" width="500"/>


or if it is not met:  
<img src="./assets/example_false.png" width="500"/>
